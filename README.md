# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
_This project is my Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate._

_It focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings using historical launch data._

## Overview
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Predicting whether the first stage will successfully land plays a crucial role in determining the overall launch cost. Leveraging publicly available data and machine learning models. 

The objective is to **predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully**

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - SpaceX REST API for detailed launch and booster data  
   - Web scraping from Wikipedia for historical data  

2. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Handling missing values and inconsistent records  
   - Feature engineering and categorical encoding  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly  
   - SQL analysis with SQLite for deeper insights  

4. **Interactive Analysis**  
   - **Folium maps** to visualize SpaceX launch sites  
   - **Plotly Dash dashboard** to explore launch outcomes by payload, orbit, and site  

5. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN  
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
   - Achieved **~83% accuracy** on test data

## Dashboard 

- Plotly dash Dashboard shows:
    - Pie chart: Displays total successful launches across all sites.
    - Scatter Chart: Shows the correlation between outcome (success or not) and payload mass.

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham-Rathore08/spacex_falcon9_first_stage_landing_prediction.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open and run notebooks:
   - `notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
   - `notebooks/vendor_performance_analysis.ipynb`
     
4. Run the Plotly Dash dashboard:
   - The dashboard uses a preprocessed dataset spacex_launch_dash.csv (already provided in `data/`)
   - To start the dashboard:
        - dashboard/app.py
